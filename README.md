### Blomming API

Now a rich set of APIs are available to developers, allowing to access almost all features of blomming kernel! Please refer to Blomming API official Documentation for details:

<p align="center">
  https://api.blomming.com/docs/v1/
</p>


## This project  

Consist of:

1. The *blomming_api* rubygem code, containing basic API client access logic (the Blomming API wrapper layer). Runtime available at the [rubygems repository](http://rubygems.org/gems/blomming_api).

The idea behind the project is to supply some HTTP Blomming API wrapper/helpers to Ruby language applications developer. In the sketch here below the usual client / server architecture:  


					.-------------------------.
					|                         |
					|    Blomming website     |
					|       API Server        |
					|                         |
					.------------++-----------.
					             ^|
					             | < --- HTTPS request (+ JSON payload) (2)
					             || < -- JSON data response (3) 
					             ||
					             |v
					.-------------------------.
					|   blomming_api gem      | 
					| (Blomming API client)   |
					|                         |
					.------------++-----------.
					             ^| 
					   	         || < -- Ruby hash in/out data (4)
	                             | < --- endpoint method invocation (1) 
	                             |v
	                .------------++-----------.
	                |     CLI Application     |
	                | (long processing batch) |
					|                         |
					|            or           |
					|                         |				                              
                    |     Web Application     |
                    |   (Rails/Sinatra/etc.)  |
	                .-------------------------.


The blomming_api gem embed some authentication logic and encapsulate marshal/unmarshal JSON data (returned by server) to/from plain Ruby hash objects.

2. `/examples` contain some tests and demo usage examples as Ruby command line interface (CLI) scripts.


## Step 1: Install the *blommimg_api* gem ! [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/blomming_api.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/blomming_api)

Above all, install the gem:

    $ gem install blomming_api

gem install also the executable (at the moment showing basic gem info and endpoints usage/inspection in future release):

    $ blomming_api


## Step 2: Authentication set-up

In order to be granted to access to Blomming API, each client must be identified by some credential values (oauth server authentication). 

### Get your Blomming API credentials

API credentials are generated by Blomming tech team for a per 3rd part application use. Please contact [api@blomming.com](mailto:api@blomming.com) and explain briefly why do you need them and how do you plan to use Blomming service. Blomming tech team will be happy to give you the full access to API!

#### Buy Services Authentication

To access Blomming APIs, each client must be identified by two credential values required as parameters of initial Blomming OAuth server bearer token request:

- *Application ID*
- *Secret*

#### Sell Services Authentication

Application ID and Secret values, are all you need to use buy services, but in case of sell services, you must authenticate supplying also your Blomming account cusername and password:

- *Username*
- *Password*


### Set-up your *blommimg_api* configuration file 

Using the blomming_api gem, a client must be "initialized" with a YAML configuration file (.yml), in order to store all Blomming API credentials data and some default API values, among others:

- *domain* (production/staging API urls) 
- *api_version* (API release number)


You have to set-up all data on a blommimg_api YAML configuration file `<your_config_file.yml>`, following these two possible skeletons:

#### Config file for *BUY services* authentication
Config file example: `your/path/to/buy_services_stage_config.yml` :

```yaml
description: my account for buy services, access to staging server 

services: buy

client_id: __copy_here_your_blomming_api_client_id__
client_secret: __copy_here_your_blomming_api_client_secret__

domain: https://blomming-api-staging.herokuapp.com
api_version: /v1

default_currency: USD
default_locale: US

verbose: false
```

#### Config file for *SELL services* authentication
Config file example `your/path/to/buy_services_prod_config.yml`:

```yaml
description: my account for sell services, access to production server  

services: sell

client_id: __copy_here_your_blomming_api_client_id__
client_secret: __copy_here_your_blomming_api_client_secret__

username: __copy_here_your_blomming_account_username__
password: __copy_here_your_blomming_account_password__

domain: https://api.blomming.com
api_version: /v1

default_currency: EUR
default_locale: it

verbose: true 
```

## Step 3: Test endpoints with examples scripts
You can quick test endpoints with some command line script utilities in directories:

- `examples/endpoints/buy/*.rb`
- `examples/endpoints/sell/*.rb`

As example of Blomming_api gem usage, I supplied some scriptswithin the project (under `/examples` directory). Here below I list few of them:

### Example 1. Simplest API usage: `categories.rb`:  

Here a cli ruby script to get Blomming categories list (country locale: ITALY):

```ruby
	require 'blomming_api'
	
	puts "usage: #{$0} <config_file.yml>" and exit if ARGV.empty?
    config_file =  ARGV[0]
		
	categories = BlommingApi::Client.new(config_file).categories locale: "it"
	
	categories.each { |item| puts item["name"] }
```

	$ ruby categories_index.rb  myconfig.yml
	Arte:Altro
	Arte:Dipinti
	Arte:Fotografie
	Arte:Illustrazioni
	Arte:Sculture
	Arte:Stampe & Poster
	Casa:Antiquariato
	...	
	...

### Example 2. using all_pages method: `categories_items.rb`: 

The gem supply the helper method `all_pages` to retrieve all items of all pages of any API endpoint:

```ruby
	require 'blomming_api'

	if ARGV[0].nil? || ARGV[1].nil?
	  puts "usage: #{$0} <config_file.yml> <category_name>" 
	  puts "example: ruby #{$0} yourconfig.yml \"Casa:Giardino & Outdoor\""
	  exit
	end
	
	config_file = ARGV[0]
	category_name = ARGV[1]
	
	c = BlommingApi::Client.new config_file 

	# retrieve all blomming categories names 
	categories = c.categories

	# get id (numeric identificator) associated to a certain category name (string identificator)
	category_id = c.id_from_name category_name, categories

	unless category_id
	  puts "category name: #{category_name} not found among Blomming categories"
	  exit
	else
	  puts "searching items for category name: \"#{category_name}\" (category_id: #{category_id})"
	end	

	# retrieve all items data associated to a category
	all_items = c.all_pages do |page, per_page| 
	  c.categories_items( category_id, {page: page, per_page: per_page} )
	end   

    # for each item: print on stdout a subset of data fields (item title, item id, shop id)
	all_items.each_with_index do |item, index| 
	  puts "#{index+1}: title: #{item["title"]}, id: #{item["id"]}, shop: #{item["shop"]["id"]}"
	end
```

	$ ruby categories_items.rb  myconfig.yml Uomo:Vintage
	searching items for category name: "Uomo:Vintage" (category_id: 113)
	collecting items from pages ....................
	1: title: Orologio Seiko vintage, id: 625777, shop: Artivoquadri
	2: title: 80s Turtleneck Biker Polo, id: 621376, shop: MadCappuccino
	3: title: joe petrosino , id: 621082, shop: otticaservice
	4: title: exess 1793, id: 621077, shop: otticaservice
	5: title: logonò 39,00 €, id: 620489, shop: otticaservice
	6: title: camicia LoonyShirt Hypnotic One, id: 619139, shop: beloony
	...
	...


### Example 3. More complex client application: `export_shop_items_to_csv.rb`: 

Let say you want to export items of your shop into a CSV file!

	$ ruby export_shop_items_to_csv.rb --help
	
	export_shop_items_to_csv.rb v.1.0 by giorgio.robino@gmail.com
	
	  Export all items data from a specified Blomming shop (shop_id)
	  creating a CSV file (shop_id.csv), using API endpoint:
	
	    https://api.blomming.com/docs/v1/shops/items-GET.html
	
	  CSV file columns format:
	
	    id,title,description,created_at,price,original_price,photo1,photo2,photo3,photo4,quantity
	
	Usage:
	  $ ruby csv_export.rb config_file.yml [options]
	
	Examples:
	  $ ruby export_shop_items_to_csv.rb myconfig.yml -d --shop-id solyarismusic
	  $ ls solyarismusic.*
	  solyarismusic.csv  solyarismusic.json
	
	  $ ruby export_shop_items_to_csv.rb myconfig.yml -s microregali -t '|'
	
	Options:
	                --shop-id, -s <s>:   shop_id, alias shop_name (default: solyarismusic)
	                      --debug, -d:   debug mode produce verbose log and generate JSON file with all data supplied by API
	             --text-quote, -t <s>:   text column delimiter character in CSV file (default: ")
	                --col-sep, -c <s>:   columns delimiter character in CSV file (default: ,)
	  --output-directory-path, -p <s>:   directory path where create CSV and JSON output files (default: )
	                    --version, -v:   Print version and exit
	                       --help, -h:   Show this message



## Step 4: Write your client API Application!

Blomming API Application usage examples:

- specific third parties search engines (to retrieve shop items by keywords, categories, collections, tags, etc.)
- m-commerce / e-commerce custom apps (by example with API you can now build and android-based app "cloning" the www.blomming.com e-commerce for general purpose or specific mobile application)
- product catalogs data exchange between blomming database and thir party CMS (content management system). So you can quickly elaborate shop items data (add, remove, update, delete) with  batch procedures operating on huge amount of data. As proof of concept I wrote a script to export shop items into a CSV (comma separated values) file (see below `export_shop_items_to_csv.rb`).
- etc.

## Release Notes

IMPORTANT:

Blomming_api gem (and usage examples in this github project) are now in a "prerelease" phase; many todo tasks need to be completed (I'll publish a more stable release by January 2014).

### v.0.3.6
- Prerelease: 28 December 2013
- buy endpoints: completed. carts endpoints must be verified with blomming tech team.
- sell endpoints: added order management. orders endpoints must be verified with blomming tech team.

### v.0.3.3
- Prerelease: 23 December 2013
- All endpoints methods correctly return Ruby hashes 
- Authentication logic adjusted
- Code refactored with better usage of modules
- Examples directory hierarchy modified
- `blomming_api` executable added in gem

### v.0.1.0
- First release: 17 December 2013


## To do

- Supply methods to fully cover Blomming API endpoints (all *buy* services endpoints are now implemented (100%) but most of *sell* services endpoints are still to be implemented (50%)
- Realize a better test framework. 
- Refactor classes architecture: now endpoints return Ruby hashes translating one-to-one JSON returned by HTTP API calls. A possible alternative implementation (v.2.0) is to create a specific Resource class for every Blomming resource (Category, Order, Shop, Item, Sku, etc.), Possibly investigate how to use ActiveResource...
- BLOMMING_API::Client.load_and_retry() method is debatable. Better manage Restclient exceptions return codes. Sleep() on retry it's a bad solution for client running as Web app, so probably a non-blocking thread architecture could be the correct way. Subclass for different behaviours on exceptions.  
- Do some Log file logic for debug. 
- write a "real-time" application demo, using full REST API, by example updating items in a shop and doing smart behaviours (like a random/time-scheduled price discount policy on certain set of a shop items...)
